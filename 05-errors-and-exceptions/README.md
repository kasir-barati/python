# Errors and Exceptions

Until now we kinda skipped errors that you might face during developing an application in Python, but you've most likely encountered them if you were practicing and trying out new stuff. Here we will talk about

- [Syntax errors](./syntax-errors.md).
- [Errors or exceptions](./errors.md).
- [`try ... except ... finally`](./try-except-finally.md)
