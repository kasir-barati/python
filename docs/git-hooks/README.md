# Pre-commit & Pre-push Git Hooks

- To add pre-push and pre-commit hooks you need [`pre-commit`](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) library.
- For linting and formatting the code I prefer [Ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> You do not need to install Ruff, it will use the link provided in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to know how it should format and lint your code.
